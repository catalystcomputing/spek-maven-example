# Spek Maven Example

This is an example project which shows how to configure [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build and run tests written using [Spek](https://jetbrains.github.io/spek/) and assertions with the [Kluent](https://github.com/MarkusAmshove/Kluent) assertion library.

For more details please see my blog post [Using Spek with Maven](http://www.catalystcomputing.co.uk/rob-westwood/2016/10/testing/using-spek-with-maven/).
